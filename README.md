AI Analytics Dashboard (TechoBRAND Insights)
A modern, AI-powered analytics dashboard built with Next.js. It helps track marketing campaigns, user insights, revenue trends, and more. Perfect for digital agencies or personal use. This project uses mock data for demonstration, but you can easily connect it to real APIs.

No more "coming soon" – everything is fully working with interactive charts, tables, forms, and AI-generated insights!

Features Overview

Analytics Page: Interactive line charts showing revenue and user trends over time.

Campaigns Page: Searchable, filterable, sortable table with pagination and CSV export for campaign data (budget, spent, clicks, etc.).

Audience Page: Pie charts for device splits and lists of insights like demographics and session data.

AI Insights Page: AI-generated recommendations (e.g., optimize campaigns) – simulates real AI with mock data; easy to integrate OpenAI for live suggestions.
